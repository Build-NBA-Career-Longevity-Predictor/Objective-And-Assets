- Where would you go?
  Giza, Egypt

- If backward, to which time period? Why?

  Whenever they built the pyramids, to know why and how the pyramids were built, because I saw just some documentary on Netflix

  Myself in 2009 and tell myself to buy bitcoin, for obvious reasons

- Would you just want to visit and come back, or would you stay?"
  come back and enjoy the riches pretty sure that's how time travel works

Forward to see if time is circular.

- If backward, to which time period? Why?
- If there was a person you could go back in time and meet, who would it be, and why?

I'm really curious about my family history, so I'd like to go back and meet a great-great-grandparent.

- Would you just want to visit and come back, or would you stay?"

Well, if time is circular, I'll hopefully end up right where I am :)
