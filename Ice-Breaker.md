## **The Time Machine**

Ask the following question, to one participant at a time: "If you were able to travel through time, either forwardÂ or backward:

- Where would you go? 

I would go to the 2010 Lakers Game 7 championship game when they beat the celtics.

- If backward, to which time period? Why? 
2010 because it's a once in a lifetime experience and moment.

- If there was a person you could go back in time and meet, who would it be, and why? 

My moms dad because I never got to meet my grandpa, so I would want to see him and get to know him.

- Would you just want to visit and come back, or would you stay?" 
Visit and comeback.
