## **The Time Machine**

Ask the following question, to one participant at a time: "If you were able to travel through time, either forward or backward:

- Where would you go?
  Giza, Egypt

- If backward, to which time period? Why?
  Whenever they built the pyramids, to know why and how the pyramids were built, because I saw just some documentary on Netflix

- If there was a person you could go back in time and meet, who would it be, and why?
  Myself in 2009 and tell myself to buy bitcoin, for obvious reasons

- Would you just want to visit and come back, or would you stay?"
  come back and enjoy the riches pretty sure that's how time travel works
