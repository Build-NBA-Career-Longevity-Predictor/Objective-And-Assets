## **The Time Machine**

### Joseph Lambert

Ask the following question, to one participant at a time: "If you were able to travel through time, either forwardÂ or backward:

- Where would you go?

Forward to see if time is circular.

- If backward, to which time period? Why?
- If there was a person you could go back in time and meet, who would it be, and why?

I'm really curious about my family history, so I'd like to go back and meet a great-great-grandparent.

- Would you just want to visit and come back, or would you stay?"

Well, if time is circular, I'll hopefully end up right where I am :)
