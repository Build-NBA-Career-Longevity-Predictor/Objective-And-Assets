## **The Time Machine**

Ask the following question, to one participant at a time: "If you were able to travel through time, either forwardÂ or backward:

- Where would you go?
- If backward, to which time period? Why?
- If there was a person you could go back in time and meet, who would it be, and why?
- Would you just want to visit and come back, or would you stay?"
