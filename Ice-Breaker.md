## **The Time Machine**

Ask the following question, to one participant at a time: "If you were able to travel through time, either forwardÂ or backward:

- Where would you go?
I don't think I want to do any time travelling because I don't like some of the negative consequences of time travel.

- If backward, to which time period? Why?
I don't think I would travel back in time any further than like 1950, because anything further and I would worry about fitting in. Traveling all the way to, say, colonial America I would worry about being accused of witchcraft or something.

- If there was a person you could go back in time and meet, who would it be, and why?
I would like to meet former Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss. We're both from the same area, we both love the Lakers, and I find him to be an incredibly interesting man.

- Would you just want to visit and come back, or would you stay?
I would absolutely come back. I have too many good things in my life to just leave.
