# Objective And Assets for NBA Career Longevity Predictor
Your one stop shop for all things Mission Critical. 

## PITCH
NBA contracts are sometimes 9 figures long. It is in a team's best interest to have a good idea of the longevity of a player's productivity. This application uses historical data to find similar players and predict a selected player's likely longevity and success in the league.
## MVP
1. An entry field for the user to enter a current college or NBA basketball player
2. A model that finds similarity between entered player and current and historical NBA players
3. A display that shows the entered player and the similar player side-by-side with statistics and other determining criteria

## DS:
- Create a predictive model for career longevity using historical player data (begin with a baseline!)
- Deploy model via Flask API to receive inputs (player names), and output predicted longevity in JSON format.

## Web:
- User creation/login flow
- Upon logging in for the first time, a user sees a form to send data to the DS API to get a result back on.  Work with the DS students to determine what should be included in the form
- When results come back the user can add a name to the player and save the results to their profile.
- User can edit the names of the players saved in their profile
- User can delete saved results from their profile
## STRETCH
Stretch:
1. Incorporate deeper data such as health data and other background information.
2. Create visualizations that compare the player with other similar players and create a predicted "career arc" that shows not just longevity but statistical production projections.

## DS: 
- Find and Add more data from additional sources to improve your model's performance.
- Create a visualization for a player's predicted longevity. 

## Web:
- Create a way to rank the players saved to the user's profile in a way that highlights the best players.
